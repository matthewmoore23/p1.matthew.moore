# CS 3366 Human Computer Interaction Project 1 Matthew Moore

#### C - I decided on one of the elevators at ULofts for my project. The overall layout of the elevator is good. It's easily accessible and readable. The buttons light up when pressed and the numbers on the side have accompanying braille under them.

#### However, it does have a glaring issue. If you add up the 7 floors, the open and close door buttons, and the alarm button you get 10 buttons. These 10 buttons are all the user feasibly needs to operate the elevator. Right above those 10 however are 12 buttons/keyholes that take up a majority of the space of the elevator UI.
#### This is bad because over half of the available options in the UI aren't accessible to the user. This wouldn't be such an issue if they didn't occupy so much space, but over 50% of the UI is taken up by it.


#### B - The most common uses of the elevator will be for the most people who use it most commonly. To go up and down floors. There are rare cases where maintenance may need access to some of the more neglected buttons, or a firefighter may need to use the elevator with a key. Overall, I think this interface is definitely sufficient for common use. The only problem I could potentially see is someone pressing the wrong door open or close button, as there is a set at the bottom for common use and near the top for fire operation only.
#### Users will most commonly get on the elevator, press the floor they need to go to, and then wait until it takes them there. It's possible they may use the open or close door function if the elevator door isn't working properly. 
#### This elevator provides ample support by being very intuitive from the get go for normal users. Aside from the large number of buttons for firefighters and maintenance use only, there few buttons that are there are simple enough that the user can figure it out on their own. The included braille under the numbers, the light up buttons, and the star to show the ground floor all support the user in operation of the elevator.
#### The elavtor provides feedback by lighting up the buttons that are pressed, playing a beep when going from one floor to another, and showing the ascent/descent at the top.
#### I think the only mistake a user could reasonably make is pressing the wrong door close or open button.
#### The only improvements I think need to be made are moving the fire operation and maintenance buttons out of the way of the user (towards the bottom) and turning the current floor UI at the top into a screen of some sort. That would change the UI at the top from being uneven into a nice, centered number. The only draw back is that the door close, open, and alarm buttons need to be repositioned in the UI panel, since those buttons, along with a fire operation button, created a nice 2x2 square at the bottom of the UI. I think it's a necessary trade off for creating more space for the common user.
